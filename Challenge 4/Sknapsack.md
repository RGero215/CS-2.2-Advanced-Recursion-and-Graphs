# Sknapsack Problem 
You are given an array of arrays. 
Each subarray in this array holds two integer values 
and represents an item; the first integer is the item's weight, 
and the second integer is the item's value. 
You are also given an integer representing the maximum capacity 
of a knapsack that you have. 
Your goal is to fit items in your knapsack, all the while maximizing 
their combined value. Note that the sum of the weights of the items 
that you pick cannot exceed the knapsack's capacity. 
Write a function that returns an array of the indices of each item picked. 

The items included in the knapsack for this optimal solution are
(("boot", 10, 60),("tent", 20, 100),("first aid", 15, 70))
